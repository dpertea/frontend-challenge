# Doria Pertea Frontend Capture the Flag Challenge

- The script used to scan the dom and get the url used to capture the flag can be found as a comment at the bottom of the App.tsx file
- This React+Vite app uses React hooks to create the typewriter effect
- the captured flag word is displayed as plain text with a typewriter effect even though list elements are used to build the flag word
- css is used modestly for pure aesthetic purposes
